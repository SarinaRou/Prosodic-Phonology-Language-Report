    <h2> Language Background</h2>
    <p>
        Farsi (also known as Persian) is an Indo-Iranian language spoken primarily in Iran, Afghanistan (as Dari), and Tajikistan (as Tajik). 
        It is head-final, SOV-structured, and typically uses postpositions rather than prepositions. 
        Its phonological system includes 6 vowels and 23 consonants, and although Persian lacks lexical tone, 
        intonation and prosody play a crucial role in structuring meaning ‚Äî especially in questions, focus, and emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Persian writing system is modified Arabic script, written right to left, which does not mark stress or intonation, 
        making spoken prosody essential for disambiguation in communication.
    </p>

    <h2>Prosodic Analysis</h2>
    <p><strong>Syllable Theory:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Persian syllable structure allows for onsets and simple codas (C)V(C).</li>
        <li>Syllables tend to be weight-sensitive, playing a role in stress placement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Stress Theory:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Default stress in Persian is typically on the final syllable of a prosodic word (Hosseini 2014).</li>
        <li>Morphological boundaries can affect stress placement.</li>
        <li>Stress is not contrastive but realized through duration, intensity, and pitch.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Foot Construction:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Evidence for right-headed trochaic feet based on syllable weight.(Farsi is written from right to left) </li>
        <li>Feet align with prosodic words, but are less prominent than in stress-timed languages.</li>
    </ul>



<p>Default Stress</p>
    <p>
        In Persian, the default stress typically falls on the final syllable of a prosodic word, resulting in a trochaic rhythm (Shahraki & Eslami, 2017; Hassan, 2015).
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: <br>
        /k√¶taÀêb/ ‚Üí [k√¶-taÀêb] (Stress on the final syllable taÀêb)
    </p>

    <p>Heavy vs. Light Syllables</p>
    <p>
        Heavy syllables (with a coda) tend to attract stress, while light syllables are generally unstressed (Kie≈Çbasa, 2002; Mazlum, 2004).
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: <br>
        /Ààk√¶t√¶b/ ‚Üí stressed on the first syllable (heavy syllable). <br>
        /k√¶ÀàtaÀêb/ ‚Üí stressed on the final syllable (heavy syllable).
    </p>

    <h1>Hosseini (2014) ‚Äì Analytical Descriptive Study</h1>

    <h2>Study Focus:</h2>
    <p>
        This research analyzed prosodic prominence in Persian and its alignment with syntactic boundaries.
    </p>

    <h2>Methodology:</h2>
    <p>
        The study analyzed spoken Persian through acoustic measurements using tools like Praat.<br>
        Data included natural speech samples to observepitch contours,syllable lengthening, and other prosodic features in different syntactic contexts.<br>
        The analysis specifically looked at the alignment of prosodic features (like pitch and duration) with syntactic structures, such as clauses and phrases.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Findings:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pitch contours, especially rising pitch, and final syllable lengthening were found to be important markers of prosodic prominence.</li>
        <li>These features were observed to align with syntactic boundaries, indicating their role in marking focus,contrast, and emphasis within sentences.</li>
        <li>The study revealed that F0 peak alignment (the pitch peak) and syllable duration are reliable indicators of prosodic prominence, signaling both emphasis and syntactic structure in Persian.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Hosseini‚Äôs study underscores the significance of prosody in marking syntactic boundaries in Persian, with implications for understanding how intonation and stress work together in communication.

   <h2>     Conclusion       :</h2>  

    <p><strong>Pitch Accents and Intonation Phrasing:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>H+L* as common pitch accent</li>
        <li>L-L% as a boundary tone for statements</li>
        <li>H-H% as a common contour for questions</li>
        <li>Two levels of phrasing: intermediate phrase (ip) and intonational phrase (ŒπP)</li>
